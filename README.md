# Node.js HTTP Server with Improved Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a simple Node.js HTTP server and then shows how to improve it by adding proper error handling.  The original server lacks error handling, making it vulnerable to crashes. The improved version handles potential errors gracefully.

## Original Server (server.js)

The original server is missing crucial error handling mechanisms, making it prone to unexpected crashes.  This is a common issue in Node.js applications.

## Improved Server (serverSolution.js)

The improved server includes comprehensive error handling.  It gracefully handles errors such as connection errors and request parsing errors, preventing unexpected crashes and providing informative error messages.
